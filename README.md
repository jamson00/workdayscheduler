# workdayscheduler

This is my module 5 project, which is a work day planner. 
at the top the title and dater are displayed, underneath are timeblocks ranging from
9am to 5 pm.

the functionality of my project is supposed to allow the user to type in an event at
each time block and save it, storing the saved event in local storage. there is currently a bug that only saves the first save and applies it to every time block.

next there are classes for each time block based on the color. if the block is gray that means it is in the past, if its red that means it is the current hour, and if it is green that means it is a future hour.
